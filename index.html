            who attended the 2018 Global Leadership Summit (“The Impact of Technology on Society”) held in Berlin, Germany. I managed several cross-functional workflows for the first-ever Partner
            Expo at this Summit which contributed to 4x more interactions between partner organizations and students than previous years. Alongside my work for the Summit, I analyzed data on customer
            retention and proposed new company-wide targets. I also collaborated with other interns to develop a business proposal that identifies innovative strategies that
            can be used to increase customer buy-in.</p1>

            I had the opportunity to carefully screen case documents, jail calls, crime scene footage and defendants’ backgrounds. Ultimately, I put everything together to formulate summaries, develop witness contact lists, interview witnesses,
            and draft subpoenas. Working so closely with Prosecutors and Defense Attorneys allowed me to get a glimpe of the challenges that plague the American incarceration system.

          <p1> As we prepare for our fifth annual hackathon to be held from November 30th to December 2nd, I am coaching sub-teams through the sponsor acquisition phase to raise $250,000. I also work with my
          co-directors to leverage team member strengths to effectively coordinate logistics (registration, transportation, venue, food, sponsors, contracting, A/V, scheduling, materials, safety) for this 36-hour hackathon.
          Prior to becoming a director of this event, I joined the team as a member. I coordinated with rideshare services to reduce airport to campus transportation costs and improve hacker experience. I also
          facilitated the formation of diverse groups and adding diversity-based activities to the 2017 YHack schedule.</p1>

          <p2> Developer | New Haven, CT </p2><br><br>
          <p1> Through a class project, I discovered that Yale students often struggle to discover career paths that interest them because of the
          university's liberal arts structure. I also knew that the career office publishes a list of graduating students (along with their major, industry, and position) each year.
          Despite the resource's potential to be immensely useful for students needing more guidance, no one really knows about these lists. My hypothesis is that
          no one is using these lists, first because they are difficult to locate and, second because they aren't easily searchable -- they're merely unlinked excel sheets. In order to make this data more user-friendly, I am building a software that uses a simple SQL backend to store all the data, Python to run the program,
          and a HTML/CSS/Javascript to receive input from the user. This project is currently in a testing phase. </p1>

          <p> Global Patterns of Gender-Based Participation in Tech Industries </p>
          <p2> Researcher | New Haven, CT </p2> <br><br>
          <p1> Last semester, I produced a research paper for a class that explored reasons why women were underrepresented in the technology industry, despite having many features that experts have stated appeal to
              women when choosing a career path (flexibility, shorter timelines, etc.). In my research, I compared primate habits to human habits and found that females are socialized to prefer to collaborate with
              all types of people while males prefer only to collaborate with males. As such, it may be that if more females enter the technology industry, males will start to exit. While this wasn't the point of
              my research for your class, I was intrigued by this theory and began to do some independent research. I am now exploring the possibility of a “gender-fication” of the tech industry by studying human
              tendencies and international patterns. </p1>

            <br> Fiction <br> This novel tells the story of a high-school girl who is outcasted after calling the cops and busting a party.
            She eventually speaks up for herself and exposes the upperclassman boy who raped her at that very party. This book exposes the struggles and challenges of being
            a disenfranchised teenager grappling with this terrible assault. I found this book to be particularly moving because of the multiple child abuse and sexual assault
            cases I witnessed during my summer internship at the Dallas District Attorney's Office.</span>

      <div class="popup w3-center" onclick="myFunction()">Click here to read about why I made this website!

        <span class="popuptext" id="myPopup"><div class="popupCloseButton">X</div>Hi there! <br><br> I started this project after a terrible experience at a hackathon. <br><br>
            Let me backtrack for a second. A hackathon is a 24 hour coding-fest hosted for people of all experience levels. With a growing interest in code
            (and frankly the free giveaways involved), I, too, signed up for this hackathon. Shortly after my friends and
            I arrived, the three of us met a group of hackers who were interested in having us join their team. As our discussions continued,
            I realized the group of hackers wanted my friends to join their team, but not me. They weren't even talking to me. But, why?<br><br>

            My friends were not more experienced than myself, they were not more charasmatic than myself, they were not more
            interested than myself. Call it jumping to conclusions or a bias or really whatever you want, but the fact that I
            cannot confidently eliminate my gender as a reason for my exclusion is a mark of concern
            not only for myself, but also for a society that prides itself on freedom and equality. <br><br>

            As I walked home angrily and teary-eyed from the hackathon, I promised myself I would learn how to code. With the help of Codeacademy and StackOverflow, I did just that. In fact, I not only learned
            how to code, but I also now will be directing that very hackathon and hope to make it a much more inclusive space. While this isn't a complex website by any means, it speaks volumes about the power
            of relentless determination. To women around the world I say, <span style="font-weight:900">dont give up. </span>We are capable of anything we set our minds to. <br><br>

            Yours truly, <br>
            Alena</span>
