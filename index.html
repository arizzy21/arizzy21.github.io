        <p> Hi Y'all! </p>

        <p> Welcome to my website. I started this project after a few men at a hackathon ticked me off.</p>

        <p> Let me backtrack for a second. A hackathon is a 24 hour coding-fest hosted for people of all experience levels. With a growing interest in code
            (and frankly the free giveaways involved), I, too, signed up for this hackathon. Shortly after my friends and
            I arrived, the three of us met a group of hackers who were interested in having us join their team. As our discussions continued,
            I realized the group of hackers wanted my friends to join their team, but not me. They weren't even talking to me. But, why?   </p>

        <p> <span style="font-weight:900">I was the only female in the group. </span>In fact, I was one of the few females in the entire room. My friends were not more experienced than myself, they were not more charasmatic than myself, they were not more
            interested than myself. Call it jumping to conclusions or a bias or really whatever you want, but the fact that I can not confidently eliminate my gender as a reason for my exclusion is a mark of concern
            not only for myself, but also for a society that prides itself on freedom and equality. </p>

        <p> As I walked home angrily and teary-eyed from the hackathon, I promised myself I would learn how to code. With the help of Codeacademy, Stack Overflow and my less mysogynistic friends, I did just that. I thank the men who tried to
            shut me out because you helped me realize that shutting me out doesn't mean shutting me up. While this isn't a complex website by any means, it speaks volumes about the power of relentless determination. To women around
            the world I say, <span style="font-weight:900">dont shut up. </span>We are capable of anything we set our minds to. </p>

        <p> Yours truly, </p>
        <p> Alena </p>

  <p> Bullet Journaling </p>
  <p1> Bullet journaling is a style of organization that can be fully personalized. This journal, which can be any journal that best fits your needs, is much like a planner - but entirely blank.
      Each page, or "spread", can be best suited to your personal organizational style. I, for example, use my journal almost exclusively for daily to-do lists and tracking the books I have read.
      I sometimes experiment with new spreads, such as finance trackers and project logs. Pinterest and Instagram serve as my main forms of inspiration, and I even run my own, small Instagram page.

  <p> Thai Cusine </p>
  <p1> On our yearly trips, my siblings and I are sure to sample a multitude of Thai restaurants. Our most favorite recommendations are <a href= "http://lersros.com" target="_blank">Lers Ros </a>in San Francisco,
      <a href="http://www.jeerathai.com/jeera-thai-new-haven/index.php" target="_blank">Jeera Thai </a>in New Haven, <a href="https://www.purethaicookhouse.com" target="_blank"> Pure Thai Cookhouse </a>in New York City, and
      <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-thip-restaurant-hurstThai" target="_blank"> Thai Tip </a>in Dallas. When I'm not eating Thai food, I try different recipies.

  <p> Reading </p>
  <p1> Books allow me to escape into another world, one where I can pretend to be a Google employee (see <a href="https://www.workrules.net" target="_blank"> Work Rules!</a> by Laszlo Block) or
       feel as though my heart has been torn a million times over (see <a href="http://nicholassparks.com/stories/at-first-sight/" target="_blank"> At First Sight</a> by Nicholas Sparks). Some of my
       favorite include <a href="https://leanin.org/book/" target="_blank"> Lean In</a> by Sheryl Sandberg and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zeitoun-Dave-Eggers/dp/0307387941" target="_blank"> Zeitoun</a>
       by Dave Eggers, which actually has a devastating backstory <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/10/us/celebrated-hero-in-zeitoun-book-faces-murder-charges-in-new-orleans.html?mcubz=0" target="_blank">

  <p> Dallas District Attorney's Office </p>
  <p2> Intern | Dallas, TX </p2><br>
  <p1> This past summer, I worked on 5 murder cases, 3 intoxication manslaughter cases, 2 manslaughter cases, 1 sexual assault case, and 2 aggravated assault of a public servant cases, one of which received significant press coverage.
    I had the opportunity to carefully screen case documents, jail calls, crime scene footage and defendantsâ€™ backgrounds. Ultimately, I put everything together to formulate summaries, develop witness contact lists, interview witnesses,
    and draft subpoenas. Working so closely with Prosecutors and Defense Attorneys allowed me to get a glimpe of the challenges that plague the American incarceration system.
